A discord bot that sends an embed along with your response containing a preview, author info, and a link to the message you're replying to.

## Instructions
1. React with a :speech_balloon: to the original message you want to reply to. *Protip: If you type speech in the emoji picker and press enter, :speech_balloon: will be probably be chosen.*
2. Type and send your message in the same channel as the original message.

Then, the bot will ping the author an embed with your message and include a link to the original message with a little text preview.

## What's the purpose of this?
Often times there are messages you want to reply to that have been buried by new messages. When you do reply to it, no one knows what you're talking about.
With this bot, the server members can easily see the context of the message you're replying to.
